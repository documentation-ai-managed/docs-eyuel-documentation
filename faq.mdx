## Content Management Tips

Organize pages with clear hierarchies and components. Use frontmatter for metadata and H2 headings to structure content.

<CodeGroup tabs="MDX,YAML">
```mdx
---
title: My Page
description: Page summary.
---
## Overview

Content starts here.
```
```yaml
# Example frontmatter
title: "API Reference"
description: "Endpoint details."
```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="info">
Avoid raw `{` or `}` in prose—wrap them in backticks like `{variable}` to prevent parsing errors.
</Callout>

## Performance and Limits

Eyuel enforces limits to ensure reliability. Review this table for key quotas.

| Feature          | Free Plan | Pro Plan   | Enterprise |
|------------------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Pages            | 50        | 500        | Unlimited  |
| Storage          | 1 GB      | 50 GB      | 1 TB       |
| API Calls/month  | 1,000     | 100,000    | Unlimited  |
| Team Members     | 1         | 10         | Unlimited  |

<Callout kind="alert">
Exceeding limits triggers soft throttling. Monitor usage in your dashboard.
