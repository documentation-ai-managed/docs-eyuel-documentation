description: Learn how to structure, collaborate on, and maintain your project's documentation effectively.

## Overview

Organize your Eyuel Documentation project to make it scalable and user-friendly. Structure pages hierarchically, leverage collaboration tools, track changes with versioning, and optimize search and navigation. Follow these practices to keep your docs maintainable as your project grows.

<Callout kind="tip">
  Start with a clear folder structure in your `docs/` directory to mirror your product's architecture.
</Callout>

## Project and Page Organization

Create a logical hierarchy for your documentation. Use folders for major sections like `guides/`, `api/`, and `reference/`. Each page requires YAML frontmatter with `title` and `description` for proper rendering.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[docs/] --> B[index.mdx]
    A --> C[guides/]
    C --> D[guide.mdx]
    A --> E[api/]
    E --> F[endpoints.mdx]
    A --> G[reference/]
```
